The Basic Rules of RPS:

Despite its underlying complexity, the gameâ€™s rules are straightforward. Players deliver hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors, with the outcome determined by these three rules:
- Rock wins against scissors.
- Scissors win against paper.
- Paper wins against rock.

Rock = 0, Scissors = 1 and Paper = 2
0 = 1 = Loose
0 = 2 = Win
0 = 0 = Draw
1 = 0 = Win
1 = 1 = Draw
1 = 2 = Loose
2 = 0 = Loose
2 = 1 = Win
2 = 2 = Draw
